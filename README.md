# Goutube
Streaming utility to build largely-scalable, highly available, fast, secure ***distributed*** streaming APIs!

### **Why build this? What's new here?**

- Simple reason is that distributed systems are cool because of many reasons and some of them are large-scalable, high availability, secure, and fast.
- With this project, I attempt to go in-depth on how to build a system that grows in functionality as well as users and the team developing it.
- It's my attempt to broaden my knowledge and make it strong by developing this real-world end-to-end product.

### **Why choose Go?**

- Simplicity
- Strongly typed and compiled
- Compiles to a single binary with no external dependencies
- Fast and lightweight
- Good coding practices
- Excellent support for network programming and concurrency
- Easy to deploy
  
### Prerequisites
- Kind tool to run a local Kubernetes cluster in Docker. (I am using: kind v0.14.0 go1.18.2 darwin/arm64)
- Go 1.16+
